Poetry helps you declare, manage and install dependencies of Python projects,
ensuring you have the right stack everywhere.

![Poetry Install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/assets/install.gif)

Poetry replaces `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.cfg`, `MANIFEST.in` and `Pipfile` with a simple `pyproject.toml`
based project format.

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "my-package"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "The description of the package"

license = "MIT"

authors = [
    "Sébastien Eustace <sebastien@eustace.io>"
]

repository = "https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry"
homepage = "https://python-poetry.org"

# README file(s) are used as the package description
readme = ["README.md", "LICENSE"]

# Keywords (translated to tags on the package index)
keywords = ["packaging", "poetry"]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
# Compatible Python versions
python = ">=3.8"
# Standard dependency with semver constraints
aiohttp = "^3.8.1"
# Dependency with extras
requests = { version = "^2.28", extras = ["security"] }
# Version-specific dependencies with prereleases allowed
tomli = { version = "^2.0.1", python = "<3.11", allow-prereleases = true }
# Git dependencies
cleo = { git = "https://github.com/python-poetry/cleo.git", branch = "main" }
# Optional dependencies (installed by extras)
pendulum = { version = "^2.1.2", optional = true }

# Dependency groups are supported for organizing your dependencies
[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
pytest = "^7.1.2"
pytest-cov = "^3.0"

# ...and can be installed only when explicitly requested
[tool.poetry.group.docs]
optional = true
[tool.poetry.group.docs.dependencies]
Sphinx = "^5.1.1"

# Python-style entrypoints and scripts are easily expressed
[tool.poetry.scripts]
my-script = "my_package:main"
```

## Installation

Poetry supports multiple installation methods, including a simple script found at [install.python-poetry.org]. For full
installation instructions, including advanced usage of the script, alternate install methods, and CI best practices, see
the full [installation documentation].

## Documentation

[Documentation] for the current version of Poetry (as well as the development branch and recently out of support
versions) is available from the [official website].

## Contribute

Poetry is a large, complex project always in need of contributors. For those new to the project, a list of
[suggested issues] to work on in Poetry and poetry-core is available. The full [contributing documentation] also
provides helpful guidance.
