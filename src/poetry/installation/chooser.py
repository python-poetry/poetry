        Function to pass as the `key` argument to a call to sorted() to sort
        InstallationCandidates by preference.
        Returns a tuple such that tuples sorting as greater using Python's
        default comparison operator are more preferred.
        The preference is as follows:
        First and foremost, candidates with allowed (matching) hashes are
        always preferred over candidates without matching hashes. This is
        because e.g. if the only candidate with an allowed hash is yanked,
        we still want to use that candidate.
        Second, excepting hash considerations, candidates that have been
        yanked (in the sense of PEP 592) are always less preferred than
        candidates that haven't been yanked. Then:
        If not finding wheels, they are sorted by version only.
        If finding wheels, then the sort order is by version, then:
          1. existing installs
          2. wheels ordered via Wheel.support_index_min(self._supported_tags)
          3. source archives
        If prefer_binary was set, then all wheels are sorted above sources.
        Note: it was considered to embed this logic into the Link
              comparison operators, but then different sdist links
              with the same version, would have to be considered equal
